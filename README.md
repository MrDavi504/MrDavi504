- 👋 Hi, my name is David, or Davi (Davi in portuguese), i'am from Brazilian.
- 🤓 I'm interested in learning about codes.
- 🐘 At the moment, my focus is on the PhP language.
- 👨‍💻 My focus on the future, at least 2-3 years from now, is starting as an information security, focused on learning the structure of websites, as my defenses will be focused on defending a website, company websites, that's why I started with the PHP.
- 🧐 But I also intend to learn about HTML, JavaScript, HTTP, etc.
- 🤗 If anyone reading this has a good tip for me, I'll be taking it! Or one the advice.
- 🤠 In second plan, I study everything that involves information security, I make use of the kalilinux tools, still in an innocent way, I may be doing something stupid, but at the same time curious, because it is in practice that I do well.
- 🤩 But at the moment, focus at the moment is to learn about websites structure, understand what's underneath, because my eyes shine for codes, my first love was for python, but I had to connect with my first love of all, which is information security.
- 🛠 Access important information, take care of it, analyze the security of sites, and look for errors and fix them, solve problems, I am very curious and committed.
